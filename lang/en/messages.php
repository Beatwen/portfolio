In 2022, I began my application development studies at IFOSUP, which fuel my passion for programming every day. In 2023, I joined Inytium as a project manager in audiovisual integration, combining my technical skills with new development knowledge to design user interfaces and automation systems for spaces like museums and conference rooms. This portfolio, hosted on a server I configured under Debian 12, allows me to experiment with various technologies and tools to keep improving in development."
