I began my studies in application development in 2022, which strengthens my desire to learn and improve my programming skills every day. Before this, I had a nearly decade-long career as a sound engineer, where I had the opportunity to work on international tours and at major events like the FIFA World Cup, as well as with renowned companies such as PRG, SoloTech CA, and Universal Music. My passion for audio, especially networked audio, led me to develop plugins for network control between my sound consoles. This technical curiosity, combined with my geeky side, naturally steered me towards programming. In 2023, I joined Inytium, where my sound engineering skills perfectly complement my new programming studies. As a project manager in audiovisual integration, I design user interfaces and develop integration logics to automate the features of spaces and buildings, such as convention halls and museums. Additionally, this portfolio is hosted on a server I set up under Debian 12. It's my personal lab where I experiment with various technologies and tools."
